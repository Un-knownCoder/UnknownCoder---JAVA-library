## How to download?
There are **2** methods:
1. Open the folder: **UnknownCoder---JAVA-library > NEW** for the newest version of the library (in the **other versions** folder there are some older versions of the **library**)

2. Open the **releases** page of this repository and, if you dont know which file you have to download, select the file called **UnknownCoder-JAVA_library-v\*.\*\*.zip**

## How to install?
If you have the **Eclipse IDE** follow these steps:
1. Create a new **project**
2. Create a folder *(I usually call it **lib**)* and put the **.jar** file in it
3. Now click with the **RIGHT mouse button** on the library and go to : **build path > add to build path**
